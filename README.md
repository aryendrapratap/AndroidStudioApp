# AndroidStudioApp

This is my **first basic experimental Android app** built using **Android Studio** and **Kotlin with Jetpack Compose**. The goal of this project was to explore app development fundamentals, UI design, and Kotlin programming while creating a functional mobile application.

## 🚀 Description

This app serves as an introductory project to Android development. It allowed me to experiment with key Android concepts such as:

- **Jetpack Compose UI**
- **State handling**
- **Activity navigation**
- **Sensor data access**
- **Basic layout structure and interactivity**

## 📱 Features

Here’s what the app currently does:

- **Displays a Business Card UI**
  - Shows a name, title, and contact details in a clean layout.

- **Includes an Action Button**
  - When pressed, it navigates to a new screen showing device sensor data.

- **Sensor Data Page**
  - Displays:
    - Light level
    - Proximity
    - Magnetometer

- **Responsive Design**
  - Uses Compose for a dynamic UI that adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Modular Codebase**
  - Clean separation between UI components and logic.
